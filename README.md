# Car Sales and Service Analysis
The objective of this project was to analyze car sales and service data to uncover actionable insights. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that effectively visualizes key performance metrics to support business decision-making.

## Situation:
- I have been hired by SwiftAuto Traders (imaginary company), a chain of car dealerships, as a data analyst. 
- I need to create some visualizations and present them as a dashboard/report to my regional manager for better understanding on car sales and profits for each dealer.

## Task:
I was tasked with:

- Analyzing car sales and service data to identify trends and patterns.
- Designing an interactive dashboard with diverse visualizations to present insights.
- Using MS Excel for data preparation and Google Looker Studio for dashboard creation.

## Action:
### Data Preparation:
- Used MS Excel to clean, organize, and preprocess the raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
- Created pivot tables and calculated key metrics, such as total profit, quantity sold, and average sales per model.

### Data Visualization:
- Utilized Google Looker Studio to design a comprehensive dashboard with interactive elements.
- Incorporated various types of charts and graphs, including:
  -- Bar charts to compare sales by car model.
  -- Line graphs to analyze trends in service metrics over time.
  -- Summary cards to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total sales and profits.
  -- Applied filters and drill-down options to make the dashboard user-friendly and interactive.

## Result:
